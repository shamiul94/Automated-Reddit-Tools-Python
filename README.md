# Python-Reddit-Bot

As a Reddit user, I felt that creating some bots for some trivial jobs might be interesting. So, I started learning how to do that. Just some simple bots to do some simple jobs. I used the `PRAW` library to build them. 

# Bots made till now
1. Delete all comments of a user
2. Delete all submissions of a user
3. Download images from a subreddit
4. Annoy a friend - Input your friends handle and the bot will reply to your friend's last 50 comments with a [Youtube link to Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) song. Let your friend know that you are always there for him.

This list will grow in future.

I would not be able to build these bots without reading [this blog](https://www.pythonforengineers.com/build-a-reddit-bot-part-1/) written by [Shantnu](https://github.com/shantnu). Thanks to him.
