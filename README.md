# Python-Reddit-Bot

As a Reddit user, I felt that creating some bots for some trivial jobs might be interesting. So, I started learning how to do that. Just some simple bots to do some simple jobs. I used the `PRAW` library to build them. 

# Bots made till now
1. Delete all comments of a user
2. Delete all submissions of a user
3. Download images from a subreddit

This list will grow in future.
